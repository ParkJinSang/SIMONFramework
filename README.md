###AI Learning Framework
=====================

SIMON is the framework for designing Artificial Intelligence.

It allows the developers applying intelligent logic efficiently, rather than using numerable "if ~ else " statement.

There is the information about files included in the source directory.

SIMON v1.1 - It has been implemented by C#, and it is the prototype of the framework. It is the most stable version among the sources now.
			 It supports the rule based AI and utility based AI modeling only by genetic algorithm.

SIMON v2.0 - It has been implemented by C#. We are trying few things to change architecture. For applying many other agents, we editted the source code.
			 'Template pattern' has been added.

SIMON Py - It has been implemented by Python. We have already known about independency toward .Net framework, so we contentrate on implementing this version.
		   It supports the rule based AI and utility based AI modeling. Additionally, we are now trying to apply reinforcement-learning algorithm.

Please read document files if you are trying the framework for the first time.
